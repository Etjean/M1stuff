    "## Introduction\n",
    "Many biological processes involve protein-protein specific interactions forming specific protein complexes. Since it can be tricky, costly, and time-spending to study such interactions with cristallography techniques, it is essential to be able to explore and predict protein-protein interactions with computer simulations, *in silico*.  \n",
    "Through the example of the Barnase-Barstar interaction, the aim of this study is to evaluate and compare two different rigid-body docking techniques : Z-Dock and FT-Dock.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Material & Methods\n",
    "The Barnase is an extra-cellular ribonuclease, and the Bastar is its proteic inhibitor. This interaction is very weel-known nowadays, so it constitutes a good test for docking algorithms. The structure of the unbound Barnase and Barstar were taken from the *Protein Data Bank* (PDB), and so was the reference complex solved by X-ray cristallography that was used to evaluate the quality of the docking results.  \n",
    "- Unbound barnase: code 1A2P\n",
    "- Unbound barstar: code 1A19\n",
    "- Complex barnase-barstar : code 1BRS\n",
    "Two docking algorithms were used to compute docking positions : Z-Dock and FT-Dock.\n",
    "Using PyMOL, the structure of the receptors were aligned together, and the Root Mean Square Deviation of the ligands (L-RMSD) were computed to evaluate the distance of the docking proposed by Zdock and FTdock to the reference docking pose.\n",

    "The parameters used to computed the docking positions were similar : grid cell span was set to 1.2 A, and total grid span to 90 A. However, The FTdock program proposes other options, such as the computation of the electrostatic charges, which was set to *off* for the calculations for time reasons. If those charges had been computed, and the grid cell span was set to a lower value, the precision would have increased, and the resulting docking positions of Zdock and FTdock may have been closer to the reference.  \n",
