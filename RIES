After my last internship ((where I performed single-molecule microscopy)), I'm looking forward to discover more about imaging techniques. Your super-resolution microscopy seem very appealling to me and it would be a great opportunity for me to come in your laboratory.


Last summer, I did a 3 months internship for my bachelors degree at the University of Edinburgh where I studied a new fluorophore for single-molecule microscopy in live cell of Escherichia coli, under the supervision of Meriem ElKaroui. She told me that she is willing to provide a letter of recommandation on your demand.

Thank you
