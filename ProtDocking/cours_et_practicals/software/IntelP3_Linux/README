				ZDOCK 2.1

This is the README file for release 2.1 of ZDOCK program. ZDOCK is an
initial stage protein-protein docking program, developed by Rong Chen 
and Zhiping Weng in 2002. It evaluates Pairwise shape complementarity, 
using Fast Fourier Transform algorithm. Detailed description can be 
found in zdock2.1.pdf. Please reference "Chen R. & Weng Z., A Novel 
Shape Complementarirty Scoring Function for Protein-Protein Docking, 
Proteins 2003;51:397-408.

This distribution includes an executable file (zdock) of the ZDOCK program,
PDB processing file (mark_sur, uniCHARMM, block.pl), and auxiliary files
(create.pl, create_lig) to create predicted complex structures from a ZDOCK
output. All files have been compiled on a GenuineIntel Pentium III processor
(http://www.intel.com/design/PentiumIII/prodbref/index.htm) with LINUX
operation system. 

Example:
mark_sur PDB new_PDB
zdock -R receptor.pdb -L ligand.pdb -o zdock.out
create.pl zdock.out

Attention: receptor.pdb, ligand.pdb and create_lig must be in your current
directory when you try to create all predicted structures using create.pl.

Standard PDB format files must be processed by mark_sur before used as the
input of ZDOCK. Formatted PDB files of docking benchmark can be downloaded at
http://zlab.bu.edu/~rong/dock/download.html. If you know that some atoms
are not in the binding site, you can block them by changing their ACE type
(column 55-56) to 19. This blocking procedure can improve docking
performance significantly. A blocking script block.pl is included, type
"block.pl" for usage information.

More options can be found by typing "zdock".

The computing time depends on the sizes of input proteins.  On average, it 
takes 1 hours with single processor with the default rotational sampling 
density of 15 degrees (without -D flag). The average computation time will
be 15 hours with 6 degree when -D flag is used.
